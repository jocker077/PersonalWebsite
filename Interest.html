        <div align="justify">
        <blockquote><blockquote><p>When I was in <i>high school</i>, I usually write <b>stories</b> on my vacant time.<sup>1</sup>I tend to like <i>reading stories</i> and it given me an idea to try and <b>write stories</b> on my own.<sup>2</sup>. I tried creating <i>fantasy stories, adventure, </i>and <i>mystery</i>.<sup>3</sup>I really enjoyed <i>writing stories</i>, it enhanced my <b>imagination</b> and it helps me to enjoy my leisure time imagining things.<sup>4</sup> it also <b>sharpened my mind</b> to <i>perceive things</i> on different perspectives to respect different opinions on how people see things through creating different characters on my stories.<sup>5</sup> At first, I only write stories on the back of my notebooks and sometimes I let my friends to read it and give criticism about my story.<sup>6</sup> Criticism helps people to grow and improves abilities on things they love to do and sometime criticism kills someone’s interest and stop them from doing things they used to.<sup>7</sup> With an immature heart, I was carried away when my very close friend told me that writing stories are for nerds and loners and also said that I don’t really have a future as a writer and eventually advices me to find much more interesting things in life so I wouldn’t grow up outdated.<sup>8</sup> I gave up on writing fictional stories, but surprisingly in High School, I became a student of a higher section who specializes on teaching Journalism.<sup>9</sup> I started to learn how to write news articles, from Fiction now to important events.<sup>10</sup> I hope writing a news is considered a skill.<sup>11</sup> Apart from writing things imaginary or events, I also love to draw because it helps me to express my ideas and emotions.<sup>12</sup> It also exercises my brain to be <i>more creative</i> and <i>unbothered</i> about the happenings on my surroundings, in-short it helped me to escape reality for the mean time.<sup>13</sup> And lastly, singing even though I don’t have a singing voice but I do love singing.<sup>14</sup> I do not know if it is considered as a talent if you’re bad at it.<sup>15</sup> I usually sing in the bathroom while taking a bath, in my room when no one’s around and sometimes at the top of the tree.<sup>16</sup> I totally envy those people who can showcase their talent and do have confidence to have an audience.<sup>17</sup> But having a skill doesn’t mean that you need to show or tell the world that you are good at something.<sup>18</sup> But also, do not let people turn you down, let your talent be your guide on the path that you want to take.<sup>19</sup> Being <i>successful</i> while being happy Is the key of having a life <b>without a regret</b>.<sup>20</sup> </p></blockquote></blockquote></div>
